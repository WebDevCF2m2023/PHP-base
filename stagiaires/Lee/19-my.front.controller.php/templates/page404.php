    <!--                    As I may have mentioned a few dozen times, I grew up with computers. When I was 2 years old, my father bought the first ever home computer (Commodore Pet) and every single upgrade that came since. I could touch-type before I could write in cursive. On Saturday morning, at 6am, or earlier, my brother and I would race down the hall because first person at the computer was the 'boss' for the day. At 6, I didn't feel well so I took a day off school. My Dad asked me to type a program into the Pet and at 9.30am, I called him in work because I'd reached the end of the 'screen' and didn't know what to do...Basically, I've never not had a computer in front of me. Ever. 
            <p> My first job working with computers came in 1997, when I started in the Voyager Internet Café (the first public internet café in southern Ireland). It was at this time that I first came across HTML (CSS was barely around at the time, then again HTML was almost new, too. I learned a little HTML but gave up because, let's face it, Notepad is not the best tool to work with). Thankfully, things have been greatly improved since then. <br>
            Then in 2000, I was in Compustore, Waterford, selling Packard Bell and Compaq computers to people discovering computers for the first time. At this time, I doubled as the shop 'tech', spending my time working on the insides of machines, repairing, upgrading and even building one from scratch.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Compustore shut down in 2001, so I ended up working as a Barman for a couple of years, during which I did a course in Visual Basic (this was back in the days before VB came to be generally hated), before I decided to move to Belgium. Since being here, I've worked in many different industries but have always wanted to return to working with computers, especially in coding as I particulary enjoyed having to 'think like a computer'. </p>
            <p>At the start of Summer, a good friend, Mark Harris told me about CF2M and the excellent courses available there. I looked through the courses available, saw the WebDev one and the rest is 'history' </p> -->
